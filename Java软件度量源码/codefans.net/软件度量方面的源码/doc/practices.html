    <h1>Development Practices</h1>

    <p>A developer who has write access to the MetricsAnalyzer repository is free to make any changes to the MetricsAnalyzer code base, update the home pages, perform releases, etc... However, certain principles and practices should be understood, agreed upon and adhered to, so that risks are minimized.</p>

    <h3>General Principles</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone is responsible for ensuring that legal issues are observed:
        <ul>
          <li>If you use code written by someone else, make sure that:
            <ul>
              <li>You have the right to use the code.</li>
              <li>You follow the license requirements carefully.</li>
              <li>Use of the code does not jeopardize the project.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>All code should carry a copyright statement.</li>
          <li>All code should preferably be under the GPL license.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Code ownership and responsibility is shared:
        <ul>
          <li>Anyone working on the project is free to change any code, as long as the other principles are observed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Simplicity first / Use refactoring to keep code simple:
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone is responsible for keeping the code and scripts as simple as possible.</li>
          <li>If the functionality remains the same, code should not be changed unless the change is towards simplicity.</li>
          <li>Code that is not going to be used, should not be added. Unused code should be removed.</li>
          <li>Clear and easy to understand code is preferred to heavy commenting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Everything that might brake should be tested (automatically)</li>
      <li>Automate everything / Keep everything automated:
        <ul>
          <li>By automating all kinds of processes (build, test, release, update, ...), working on the project will be easier, safer and faster.</li>
          <li>Anyone working on the project should have the knowledge and skills required to perform a release, for instance.</li>
          <li>If someone, for example, makes a change to the release process, others do not necessarily need to know about it, because the change is automatic.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I must admit that for some reason I didn't feel necessary to write as many automated unit tests while working on this project as I usually do. That doesn't mean that automatic testing should not be used. I'll probably write more tests for the code when I change it more fundamentally.</p>

    <h3>Preferred Java / Formatting Style</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Wildcard import statements should not be used, because they introduce the risk that code may break when new classes are added to external packages. It is better to not use wildcard import statements than fix things later.</li>
      <li>Import statements should be kept sorted so that it is easier to search them.</li>
      <li>Tab-characters should not be used, because they cause formatting problems between just about any tool. Most editors have an option to not insert tabs.</li>
      <li>Observe Sun's naming conventions. (Feel free to correct violations of the naming conventions.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I personally use <a target="_top" href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">JDEE</a> / <a target="_top" href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a> as my development environment, because the environment allows me to easily automate everything. For example, it inserts import statements and keeps them sorted for me.</p>
