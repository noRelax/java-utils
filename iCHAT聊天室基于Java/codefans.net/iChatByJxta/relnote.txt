iChat LE 1.1 Release Notes:

New Features and Fixed Bugs:

1. Remind sound is played when new messages comes.

2. Empty message is blocked to send.

3. Connect dialog now has default button, that is, you just press Enter and then it connects.


If you face any problem, just write to allenchue@gmail.com.

And I'd like to mention that the coming iChat LE v2.0 will be a great shock.
