Help Test java.net Upgrade Java.net has begun the upgrade process to the newest CollabNet software version. Testing is underway on the staging site, stage.dev.java.net through April 3, and we'd like you to confirm that your project's pages look and behave as they should. To visit the staged version of your project, add "stage." before "dev" in the URL; for example, https://phoneme.dev.java.net becomes https://phoneme.stage.dev.java.net. Note that the pages on the Staging Site are light blue-green, so that you know you're on the staged upgrade site. There will also be a 30-minute WebEx session today (March 23) at 10AM PDT to discuss finding and fixing upgrade problems. To join, go to http://collabnet.webex.com/, go to "join a meeting" and click "upgrade", enter password "fixitnow", and provide your e-mail and name. A conference call version of this WebEx session is also available: call 1-877-326-2337 (international dial-in 303-928-3232) and join conference ID 44 71 955. Deadline for Google Summer of Code / SIP  Communicator Monday is the deadline for joining the Google Summer of Code SIP Communicator project. The SoC program provides stipends to students working on open source projects, and java.net's SIP Communicator is one of the approved projects. If you're a student, join in, pick a project idea, and you can get paid to help contribute to this Java-based audio/video internet phone and instant messenger project. And if you're not communications-savvy, you might be interested in OpenOffice.org's Summer of Code projects instead.NetBeans Wins Three Jolt Awards NetBeans nabbed three Jolt Awards at the 17th Annual Jolt Product Excellence Awards ceremony.

And some new stuff we will show at JavaOne 2007 Doing our presentation for JavaOne, Fabiane Nardon and I, we had several points about what we could put on slides. Unfortunately, we can't put everything we already done using EJB3, because we have only 1 hour to speak. This post shows some stuff we decided take out from official presentation. - Edgar Silva Who wants multiline JXLabel, ever? Does anybody ever had a need for JLabel that would split text in multiple lines automatically? That is, without having to change text to html. Would it be useful to have this on JXLabel? I've added experimental version of JXLabel with support for splitting text in multiple lines. It's in the incubator under /src/rah003/java/org/jdesktop/swingx. At the very same place there is also the small demo which shows how it works/looks like at runtime. Support is done exactly same way as for JTextComponent children, and in fact reuses lots of code form there. ¡ª rah003 Re: Injection of ref to EJB fails When you are starting from Java, you have the luxury of not specifying any of the attributes for @WebService and let the container default to the spec defined default values. But when you are starting from WSDL, the @WebService annotation in the endpoint implementation class should match the corresponding ones in the WSDL - else the mismatch will cause the issues that you faced. Generally the IDEs will take care of this matching while creating the @WebService annotation in the endpoint impl class but if you are using basic editors and you are creating the endpoint impl class manually, then you have to match the values.- Painters: The problem with caching I wanted to lay out the
